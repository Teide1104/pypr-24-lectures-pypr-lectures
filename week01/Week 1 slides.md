## Course summary

- First: **programming fundamentals** using **Python**.
- Then, practical applications in **data manipulation and visualisation**.

No previous programming experience is required!

You will learn to use **professional programming workflows and tools** (git + GitHub, VSCode in particular), and you will have the opportunity to **collaborate** with peers to develop your skills.

------

## A typical week

- In your own time: watch 1-2 short **videos**, and complete a **tutorial notebook** with interactive examples and exercises.
- **Lecture**: Mondays 1.10-2pm. Code-along examples reviewing the previous week. Bring your laptop!
- **Workshop**: Thursdays or Fridays (depending on your group). Work on a programming task in groups of 2-3.
- Short **weekly homework**: either quiz (autograded), or peer-assessed code review.

--------

## Assessment

- **4 quizzes**: best 3 out of 4 count for a total of 15% (5% per quiz).
- **4 code reviews**: best 3 out of 4 count for a total of 5% (1.67% per code review).
- **Project 1**: done individually, halfway through the semester, counts for 40%.
- **Project 2**: done in small teams during workshops starting Week 8, counts for 40%. Extract some interesting information from a given dataset, and produce a report with carefully designed data visualisations.

--------

## Some advice

There is no exam -- but **you should still study**!

- Make yourself a notebook with your own notes; do the practice exercises; revise previous weeks; quiz yourself; etc.
- Prepare for the assignments like you would prepare for an open-book exam.

---

## Some advice

- Your **workload will get high** in the second half of the semester. Making sure you're well-prepared for the assignments means that you will spend **a lot less time** on them.
- This will also help you **develop and retain** your programming skills -- and, more generally, your computational thinking skills -- much more efficiently.

## Generative AI

- Inform yourself about the ethical and energy costs of training and using LLMs.
- Inform yourself about how they work -- why they don't "reason", despite claims to the contrary.

## Generative AI

- They _can_ be useful tools for certain tasks in programming work, and they _can_ be useful to help with learning, but only:
    1. ***if you know how to ask the right questions***, and
    2. ***if you know how to critically evaluate the output***.
- Learning Python "the old-fashioned way" is how you get these skills.
